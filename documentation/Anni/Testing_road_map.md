CI/CD - GitHub Actions

To-do:
- Set up GitHub Actions to createpull requests and run tests on code push? Is that a good idea?
- set up docker
- agregate reporting into one folder

Core test scenarios:
- User authentication (registration, login, logout)
- Basic forum functionality (viewing posts, creating posts, commenting)
- Critical user interactions (navigation, error handling)
- Chat function (messaging, notifying, user interaction)
- Error handling (error messages, recovery)

Expanded testing:
- Performance testing
- Data management tests
- API testing (backend endpoints, data integrity)
- Session and/or state management
- Visual testing
- Add cross-browser testing
